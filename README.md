Phase 0: 

Currently, we have two data sets, one of generation one pokemon and their information, and one of pokemon types and their effectiveness. 

We chose to make two graphs using this data. One of pokemon types and their weaknesses, and one of their strengths. These graphs will be directed. We also plan to make a user interaction portion in which a user can select a pokemon and recieve the types that pokemon is strongest and weakest against. 

Phase 1: 

Phase 2: 
We made methods to access the data in our graph. First, we made a hashtable to align each pokemon to their types. The pokemons are the keys while the types are the values. Some pokemon had multiple type, so we set it as a list of types. Then, we constructed methods to access the types. We added generic methods that showed the number of degrees per node, the node with the maximum degree, the node with the minimum degree, the average degree number of the nodes. We also made a breadth first traversal for the types in the list. To make this more interactive, we used Scanner for users to choose what data they want to view.
