Phase 0: 

Currently, we have two data sets, one of generation one pokemon and their information, and one of pokemon types and their effectiveness. 

We chose to make two graphs using this data. One of pokemon types and their weaknesses, and one of their strengths. These graphs will be directed. We also plan to make a user interaction portion in which a user can select a pokemon and recieve the types that pokemon is strongest and weakest against.
